# Github Finder
GitHub Finder is a React-based web application that allows users to search for a GitHub user by entering their username. Once a user is found, the app displays their profile information, including their bio, avatar, and username. Additionally, the app shows all the public repositories of that user, as well as the number of stars they have received.

Moreover, the app displays the user's achievements on GitHub, such as their followers, following, and the number of public gists. With this information, users can quickly get a snapshot of a GitHub user's activity and popularity. The app is built using React, along with the GitHub API to fetch data and display it on the page.
